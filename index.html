				<div class="aboutmepara1"> Hello! My name is Meghana Rao. Over the last 3 years, I was Co-founder of an e-commerce start-up Aniika (www.aniika.com), which was the first online platform for shoppers in the United States to buy limited-edition lifestyle products from independent Indian designers. I raised $375,000 in angel funding, scaled the business to thousands of satisfied customers and increased the company revenues by over 2500% with minimal marketing spend. For various professional and personal reasons, we closed Aniika.com in December 2014.
				Prior to starting Aniika, I was a management consultant for 5 years. I specialized in helping multinational corporations such as Dell, AT&T, PayPal, Intuit etc align their human capital strategy with their overall business strategy.</div>
				<div class="aboutmepara2" >My start-up experience at Aniika introduced me to what I love doing - creating web experiences that meet and exceed customer needs. My experience as an ecommerce entrepreneur taught me how to analyze online consumer behavior. As a natural next step, I wanted to learn how to actually build the online experience they are looking for. For this, I decided to invest my time this year in learning front-end programming. This resume is my first work as a front-end programmer. </div>
				<div class="aboutmepara3">I love start-ups. I have the drive, passion, tenacity and breadth of experience start-ups look for. More specifically, I am interested in Product Management for start-ups. Product management encompasses most of the technical and behavioral competencies I have developed in my career to date. My experience in consulting required me to be proficient at market research and creative problem solving. My experience as an entrepreneur taught me how to balance the big picture with the details, to get the job done no matter what via networking & collaboration, prioritize, simplify and most importantly to think big. I loved that I needed to dirty my hands across all functions and be the binding force across functions. I consider Product Management to be similar â€“ it is the glue between business development, product development, and the users.</div>
